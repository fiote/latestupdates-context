# Lastest Updates

### Description

A small and simple news CRUD.

### Challenges Encountered

I first did it without using context features. A lot of setStates variables all around being passed down for each child component. It worked, but the code was... [kinda messy](https://github.com/fiote/latestupdates-hooks).

Then I started rewriting it using context to store/manage my data, and suddently I was using just a few function to manage all my data with some points consuming it. I would say the code is way better now.

### Technologies

React with Typescript.
